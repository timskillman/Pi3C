    Transparent Isoslices
	---------------------

	Quasi diffuse-lit transparent isosurface slices. I had to get a little inventive -
	both with the character shuffling and the methodology - to make this work.

	I don't know if anyone's noticed this, but 280 characters is not a lot to work 
	with. :) I mean, you could order a beer in under two tweets, but you couldn't chat 
	up the bar maid... OK, some people on Shadertoy probably could. :D

    p.z += iTime; 
    
    
    // Chopping the field into horizontal strips. It's quite a brutal approach, and it only works
    // because of the volumetric-like traversal. By the way, if you comment the line out, the 
    // isolines disappear, along with 22 characters, but it wasn't the look I was after.

    // few characters as possible. :)

        // been shuffled around to save a few characters. By the way, the return distance, "m(o),"
        // is absolute to ensure that the ray continues travelling forward.    
        j = m(o)/3.,
        
        // If the distance to the surface comes within a certain threshold, add some lighting
        // based on said distance. The "m(o + const)" is an old trick. It's kind of a meld between 
        // directional derivative lighting and occlusion... Something like that anyway. "j" is
        // represetative of the current ray-to-surface distance. "o.z" is a rough approximation
        // of the total distance, and is used for attenuation. Using "o.z" has the added benefit of
        // giving the lighting a slight parallax feel.
        //
        // On a side note, using an "if" statement cuts down on characters, but I wanted this to
        // be branchless to save a few cycles.

        // which is apparently slower than the following. I read somewhere that the ternary 
        // operator isn't guaranteed not to branch on nontrivial calculations, but chances are
        // minimal, or something to that effect. I've also read that it never branches with certain
        // shader languages? ... I'll leave the debate to the experts. :)
