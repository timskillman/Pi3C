+=working on it

+ 2/3/4 point modelling of shapes
  * All shapes now have multi-point creation
  * Shape creation needs to rotate into view
  * Info whilst generating shapes
* Speed up UI/editing esp. for Pi Zero
- OBJ grouping
- Group / Ungroup selection
- Rotate selection
+ Line/curve drawing to create Extrude & Lathe
- Create line / pipe
- Slices for shapes (Enter parameters)
- Point/Facet/Line editing
* Flight mode 
  * WASDRF keys
  * Fullscreen
- Walk in scene (with colliders)
+ View points & navigation 
  * Jump to point
- Flight path
- Animate selection;
  - Rotate
  - Slide
  - Oscillate
  - Hit button(s) to start/stop animation
  - Animate shape on path
    - tilt along path
- Add/replace texture (drag and drop initially)
- Material selection menu + options
- Drop OBJ on scene object and align with normal direction of object face
- Add behaviour to shape paths (e.g. pause or wait for interaction) - keyframe system
- Merge lightmaps with texture UV's tool and shaders
- Add UV mappers
- Transparencies need to merge with other file imports
- LOD
  - Appear from distance / hide other object(s)
  - Appear only when inside / exclude outside objects (show visible triangle count)
  - Appear only when arriving at specific volume(s)
  - Simulated testing
  - Swap textures in/out
  - Pause states while loading
- Write generic file dialog window
- Clean up
  * models (non system)
  * materials & textures (non system)
  - VBO's (non system)
