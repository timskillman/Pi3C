# Pi3C

Pi3C is a C++ graphics engine and toolkit designed for the Raspberry Pi and works on other platforms such as Windows and Android.

It is designed to encourage youngsters and anyone interested in programming by exploring the games and apps provided.

These range from a few lines of simple, self explained code to more complex, real-world examples.

Pi3C tries to avoid the complexities of C++ by providing a top-level class called Pi3C. This class has simple commands to help you start your journey into the exciting world of programming.

Even though Pi3C is simple, is provides top class functions to render incredible graphics when you consider the low cost of a Raspberry Pi.
In fact, I'm confident that you will be amazed at what can be achieved on the Raspberry with just a few lines of code using Pi3C.

Pi3C also includes tools such as a 3D modeller and games editor with 1st person capabilites for testing scenes.  
Other tools will include a Style editor (to help design a Graphics User Interface (GUI)) and a project kickstarter.

I hope that you will enjoy your experience with Pi3C!
