/*
	The Two tweets challenge 2015 is over.

	An overwhelming	amount of great stuff has been submitted in
	the past 2 weeks, I was expecting maybe a dozen entries and
	we are at 105 at the time of this writing.

	Thanks to everyone who participated and helped make this
	fun and interesting.



	Judging:
		Fow anyone who wants to help with judging, you can
		send you top 5 picks in order (from #1 to #5, best being #1)
		via	email at: nimitzstg at gmail.com
		Anyone who participated in the tournament can
		be a judge, just let me know what's your shadertoy
		username in the email. Only restriction is you can't
		vote for your own shaders and you must send exactly
		5 picks. You can vote for multiple shaders of a single
		user in your top 5.

	TLDR:
		-Send your top 5 shaders in order from best to worst
		-Don't vote for yourself
		-Mention your shadertoy username
		-You can vote for multiple shaders of a single user

	Points Calculation:
		Every judge has the same voting weight, your
		first pick gets 1 point, second 0.75 points,
		third 0.5625 points and so on (n+1 = n*0.75).
		Winners are the shaders with most points.
